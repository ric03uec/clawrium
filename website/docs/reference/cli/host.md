---

## clawctl host create

Register a host with the fleet.

```bash
clawctl host create <hostname> --user xclm [--alias NAME] [--port PORT]
```

On first run for a hostname, this command generates a per-host SSH keypair
under `~/.config/clawrium/keys/<hostname>/` and tries to verify SSH access
as `xclm`. If that fails (typical on a fresh host where `xclm` does not
yet exist), it prints the Linux and macOS manual setup commands — with
your freshly-generated public key embedded inline — and exits non-zero.

Run those commands on the host (see [Host Preparation](../../guides/host-setup.md)),
then re-run `clawctl host create` to actually register the host.

The `--bootstrap` flag was removed in #547. It promised automatic xclm
setup but required the bootstrap user to already have passwordless sudo,
which was the same precondition manual setup ends with.

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `hostname` | Host IP address or hostname |

### Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--port` | `-p` | SSH port (default: 22) |
| `--user` | `-u` | Management user on the host (must be `xclm`) |
| `--alias` | `-a` | Friendly name for this host |

### Example — first run (xclm not yet set up)

```bash
$ clawctl host create 192.168.1.100 --user xclm --alias pi-lab
Generating SSH keypair for '192.168.1.100'...
Keypair created: /home/user/.config/clawrium/keys/192.168.1.100/xclm_ed25519.pub
xclm SSH verification failed: Authentication failed - check SSH keys

Manual setup required. Log into the host with a sudo-capable user and
run the block that matches its OS:

## Linux
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash xclm
…

## macOS
sudo dscl . -create /Users/xclm
…
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a xclm -t user com.apple.access_ssh

Then re-run: clawctl host create 192.168.1.100 --user xclm
```

### Example — re-run (xclm configured)

```bash
$ clawctl host create 192.168.1.100 --user xclm --alias pi-lab
host/pi-lab created on 192.168.1.100:22
```

### Host Key Verification

If the host key is unknown, the command surfaces a prompt and exits non-zero. Run `ssh -p <port> xclm@<hostname>` once to record the key, then re-run `clawctl host create`.

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Host registered (or already exists with matching settings) |
| 1 | xclm SSH verification failed (manual setup needed), or host already exists with different settings |

---

## clawctl host edit

Edit a host record in place — update the SSH user, SSH port, or alias.

```bash
clawctl host edit <hostname> [options]
```

The host is identified by its existing name or alias (the positional
`HOSTNAME` argument). At least one option must be provided.

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `hostname` | Existing host name or alias to edit |

### Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--user` | `-u` | New SSH user |
| `--port` | `-p` | New SSH port (1–65535) |
| `--alias` | `-a` | New friendly name for this host |
| `--hostname` | | New IP address or hostname (e.g. after a DHCP lease renewal). `key_id` is preserved. |

### Example — change SSH user

```bash
$ clawctl host edit mybox --user ops
```

### Example — change SSH port

```bash
$ clawctl host edit mybox --port 2222
```

### Example — change alias

```bash
$ clawctl host edit mybox --alias lab-pi-4
```

### Example — change IP address (DHCP renewal)

```bash
$ clawctl host edit mybox --hostname 10.0.0.55
```

When `--hostname` is used, `hostname` and the primary `addresses[]` entry
are updated atomically; the host's `key_id` (and therefore the SSH key)
is preserved so per-agent secrets stored under the host remain valid.
Confirm the public key is still present in `authorized_keys` on the new
address.

### Example — change several fields at once

```bash
$ clawctl host edit mybox --user ops --port 2222 --alias lab-pi-4
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Host updated successfully |
| 1 | Host not found or invalid input |

---

## clawctl host get

```bash
clawctl host get
```

## clawctl host delete

---

## clawctl host address add

Add an address to a host.

### Example

```bash
$ clawctl host address add pi-lab 100.64.0.50 --label tailscale
Address '100.64.0.50' (tailscale) added to host 'pi-lab'
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Address added successfully |
| 1 | Host not found or address already exists |

---

## clawctl host address remove

```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Address removed successfully |
| 1 | Host not found, address not found, or cannot remove primary |

```

Shows the primary address (used for all downstream commands) and any secondary addresses for different network contexts.

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `host` | Host hostname or alias |

### Example

| `address` | Address to make primary |

### Example

```bash
$ clawctl host address set-primary pi-lab 100.64.0.50
